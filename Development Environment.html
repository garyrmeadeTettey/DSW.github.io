        <h3>What are development Environments</h3>
        <p>A development environment in software and web development is a workspace for developers to make changes without breaking anything in a live environment.
         The development environment is often seen as a developer's “everything-goes” workspace. 
         When working with a development environment it is part of a tiered structure of environments, where changes are deployed through different environments before reaching a live website.
         A typical environment structure includes a local, a development, a staging, and a live environment, but it can include more or fewer environments depending on the needs and processes of those developing the website.</p>

                <td>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.
                     It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.While marketing primarily to professional programmers, VS Code is an excellent editor for students and other learner just getting started with HTML and CSS. 
                     This course focuses mainly on those students and learners who in the beginner to intermediate stages of learning to code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</td>
        
                <td>They have great products. I use IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm and DataGrip on daily basis and they are very useful. I am buying their all product pack subscription for individuals and it doesn't seam to be pricey. Seams pretty reasonable pricing to me for a full-time employee software developer.
                    Text completion, refactoring, extensive plugin support are some of the pretty good features. It hasn't been sluggish on my machine and is in fact quick to perform some tasks that might otherwise be quite time consuming. Overall, I think its an efficient application to make efficient applications

                <td>Brackets works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly, so your browser preview is always up to date while you're coding — no page reloads needed. In order to keep your current web browsing unaffected, Brackets Live Preview opens an additional copy of Chrome using a separate Chrome profile
                    It's worth pointing out that Brackets is primarily aimed at front end developers and web designers. Although it's essentially a text editor and therefore suitable for coding pretty much anything, it's optimized for HTML, CSS, and JS
